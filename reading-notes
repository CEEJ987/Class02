# Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is the ability to develop & adapt under any circumstanstances and all environments. ***NOT ACCEPTING FAILURE*** or settling for less. Learning your value increases your rates of success. 

### Things to remember
1. Maintain leveled headspace
2. Dedication to a Set time for studying
3. Practice what I have learned on a regular basis.
